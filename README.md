![alt tag](https://vgy.me/gGnCX5.gif)

An artificial intelligence using probability based heuristic to find its way through a dungeon.
His goal is to find the hole to next floor while avoiding monsters and traps. His vision is limited to the single cell he is standing on, therefore he makes use of signs (bones and trash) that warn him about adjacent dangers.
